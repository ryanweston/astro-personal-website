There's always a new technology to learn, a theory or concept to revise or a skill to practice. As software engineers, we've comitted to a lifelong journey of learning. But often we have our fingers in a lot pies. Technology excites us, and we want to know how it works inside and out. But if you're not consistently using that technology and building up a solid mental model, it's hard to recall after some time.

Tools, by the nature of evolution, have made our lives easier. All the gnarly configurations are abstracted away from us and have allowed us to be more productive and build powerful products quicker. However with so much abstraction, it becomes hard to get into the gnitty gritty of how things are working when you peel back the layers. And the tools are so good, often we don't really have to know.

The issue with this is being when you encounter a bug that then requires that deeper level of understanding. Because of this it takes longer than you'd like to figure it out. And because more often than not, we're not working at that level of understanding, it's soon forgotten.

I've found a similar sentiment with Dan Abramov's course where he discusses and reteaches mental mondels of Javascript. Ironically, this realisation came to fruition when working with server routes on latest prerelease of NextJS while working on my side project Predictable. 

Having primarily worked with VueJS and not touched much in the way of full stack projects or server side work recently. From my understanding that a lot of responsibilities for frontend technolgoies are now being moved to the server, I realised I needed to at least begin consilidating my learnings. 

I need to read, understand then consilidate my knowledge so as to not forget it all in a week. My solution to this is to start this blog. My goal is to provide more in depth posts, structured as questions as they come to me and what I've learnt to solve them. Basically, I'm putting myself back into school. Feel free to join me on this journey.
