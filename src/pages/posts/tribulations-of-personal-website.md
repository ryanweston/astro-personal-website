I'm a self described 'glass half full' designer. The majority of the time I'm never content with my work. There are those times however, following my 100th tweak of the same button's border in the space of a couple hours, I can take a deep breath and smile. I sit back and take in the composition from every angle possible to make sure, just one last time, that I'm somewhat content. I can sleep in peace.

Then I wake up. Wiping the sleep dust from my eyes and sitting back in front of my monitor, I catch a glimpse of that design again as I flick through my open windows. 

You can guess what happens next. 

I'm sure I'm not the only one that experiences this, and understands that it can be wholy grating at times. However, you can always find some relief in feel-good pretentious mum quotes. "True creatives are never satisified". 

But the most difficult challenge to overcome, and in my opinion, the most dangerous hill to climb, is designing for yourself. At least for myself anyway. Whether it's personal branding, a side project or that seventh portfolio redesign of the year (and we're only halway into Februrary), the imposter syndrome can feel chronic. 

There's no final handoff when it comes to your identity or your work. 

For years, like many designer, I've struggled to find a style. What represents me best? I've tried brutalism, swiss inspired, you name it, I've tried it. Each time similar questions arise.

- Who's this for?
- Who's going to looking at this?
- What is the given user looking at this for?
- What context has the user come from?
- What does this say about me?

This is good, these questions regarding the user should be asked. But when you're providing the brief for yourself in this case, a lot of these questions I can't really answer. And stuck in a decision paralysis loop, none of these redesigns see the light of day. 

How can I get feedback or truly improve however, if none of this work sees the light of day? In engineering terms, specifically with side projects, just ship it. You can iterate at a later date, with proper feedback. You can adjust it as your audience changes, instead of making large presumptions for these questions.

With that in mind, came my final (at least I hope) redesign for a while. I even managed to answer a few of the questions above.

Whos this for? Myself, I want a personal platform to share my writing and a brief description of what I do. I don't want to share every side project, just a couple. So I don't need anything monumental and I don't currently have any in depth case studies.

Who's going to look at this? Myself most likely, I'm not actively looking for new roles at the moment and even if I was, the above information I believe would be more than enough for a interviewer.

Previous designs have been verbose, when in reality I just needed two things. A description, a couple of links to side projects, and a blog. Why over complicate things? With that sentiment, I also realised that by approaching my site in this way, I could translate that neutrality and perhaps over simplification into my design. 

In all honesty, I'm not sure how to resolve this conflict and I'm also not entirely sure it's a bad thing! It's how I improve, despite being difficult to manage mentally at times, that much I can't deny.
